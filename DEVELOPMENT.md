# Development

### Getting Started

- Install the dependencies

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

- Create a symlink

  ```bash
  npm link
  ```

- You're all set now, open help to see a list of commands

  ```bash
  codiga --help
  ```

### Running the tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Notes

- If you're using `nvm` to change between node versions, you'll need to repeat the above for each version as the symlink step only links with the current node version.
